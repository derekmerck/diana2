HISTORY: Solitary pulmonary nodule; Multiple pulmonary nodules, one year follow up



SMOKING HISTORY: Current smoker. Approximately 4 cigarettes a day.



TECHNIQUE: Multidetector row CT volumetric acquisition was performed through the chest without IV contrast. A targeted CT protocol using this patient's history and dose modulation techniques based on this patient's anatomy was employed to minimize radiation exposure. Image post processing was performed in the coronal plane.



COMPARISON: CT chest dated XX/YY/2016



FINDINGS:

Lungs and Airways: Unchanged 2 mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule (series 2 image 14), unchanged right upper lobe pulmonary nodule (series 2 image 30), unchanged 4 mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodules (series 2 image 32 and image 34), unchanged right lower lobe 2.0 cm groundglass nodule (series 2 image 76).

Limited Upper Abdomen: No significant abnormality.



DOSE: CTDIvol = 2.72 mGy



IMPRESSION:

Unchanged bilateral pulmonary nodules.



LUNG SCREENING: Benign in appearance/behavior. Significant other findings. Lung-RADS category 2S.

Management recommendation: Continue annual screening with low-dose CT in 12 months.
